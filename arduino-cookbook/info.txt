- Arduino Software and Sketches
  Software programs, called sketches, are created on a computer using the Arduino (IDE). 
  The IDE enables you to write and edit code and convert this code into instructions that 
  Arduino hardware understands. The IDE also transfers those instructions, in the form of 
  compiled code, to the Arduino board (a process called uploading).
